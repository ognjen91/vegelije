1. defining relationships
2. since there is no 'password' column in users table, I assume that authentification isn't the most important part
   of this testing app; therefore, I made the most simple login/logout system which doesn't require password to log in.
   I always use Laravel auth system anyway.

3. To check if the criteria for starting conversation exists, in Like Model I've created a method that checks if
   users liked each others(method 'isMatching')
